    "text": "This blog post series will explore bias between various models’ image generation. In this second post, I will visually compare the models’ responses to two prompts involving roles in a professional context.\nAll generated images are visually similar, with five out of the six images featuring the subject and object of the prompt as a (typically older) white male. The exception is Dall-E Free’s “doctor treating a patient” image, in which the doctor is again a white male, but in which the patient has no identifying features visible. Dall-E Free’s images again appear more stylized, but for the most part, it seems clear that the platforms are indistinguishable with respect to bias.\n\n\n\nbias-profession.png"
